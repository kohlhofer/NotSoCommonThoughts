Writing clean code is an art that combines technical skill with thoughtful design. Here are the fundamental principles that will help you write better code.

## Core Principles

### 1. Meaningful Names
- Use intention-revealing names
- Avoid disinformation
- Make meaningful distinctions
- Use pronounceable names
- Use searchable names

### 2. Functions
- Keep them small
- Do one thing
- Use descriptive names
- Minimize arguments
- Have no side effects

### 3. Comments
- Write comments that explain why, not what
- Avoid redundant comments
- Keep comments up to date
- Use comments to explain complex algorithms

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
- Keep related code together
- Use consistent formatting
- Implement proper error handling

### Testing
- Write tests first (TDD)
- Keep tests clean
- Test one concept per test
- Make tests fast and independent

## Conclusion

Clean code is not just about following rulesâ€”it's about writing code that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. Remember: code is read more often than it is written.

Field Bureau + Werkstatt is an independent design and technology practice. Bureau for analysis and discernment. Werkstatt for experimentation and craft. Field for real-world context and iteration.

The design tries to capture and reflect that ethos. So does the process of making it.

## Iteration Over Implementation

I started with an absolute minimal sketch from my journal. Just a rough version of the key elements—logo, concept, navigation. The rest happened through iteration.

Initial implementation was quick thanks to AI. Then came the real work: spacing, typography scale, color values, image treatment. Design decisions that require looking, adjusting, looking again.

I like it best on desktop (see screen) but it scales nicely to mobile too. Learn about [Field Bureau + Werkstatt](https://fieldbw.com).

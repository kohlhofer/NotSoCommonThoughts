Field Bureau + Werkstatt is an independent design and technology practice. Bureau for analysis and discernment. Werkstatt for experimentation and craft. Field for real-world context and iteration.

The design tries to capture and reflect that ethos. So does the process of making it.

## Bureau, Werkstatt, Field

**Bureau:** I developed the key concept and captured it in a minimal (and tiny!) sketch in my journal. Just the essentials: logo, concept, navigation.

**Werkstatt:** Initial implementation was quick thanks to AI. Then came the real work: spacing, typography scale, color values, image treatment. Design decisions that require looking, adjusting, looking again.

**Field:** A timely design critique with [John](https://www.johnwlong.com/) brought real-world perspective that refined the final result.

I like it best on desktop (see screen) but it scales nicely to mobile too. Learn about [Field Bureau + Werkstatt](https://fieldbw.com).

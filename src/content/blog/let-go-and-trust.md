This section from another post makes for a good reminder for myself: 

> My experience as a manager and team leader has taught me that the best results come when you let go of control and trust the people (and now, the tools) you work with. Excellence rarely comes from micromanagement or rigid prescriptions—it comes from creating space for others to contribute, experiment, and surprise you.

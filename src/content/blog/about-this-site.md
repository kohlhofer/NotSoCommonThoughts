*I asked an AI to analyze the content and create a description:*

> Not So Common Thoughts is a personal blog exploring the intersection of design, technology, and human creativity. Through thoughtful analysis and personal experiences, it examines how modern tools and AI are reshaping our approach to design, coding, and creative work, while maintaining a focus on the human elements of judgment, intuition, and meaningful decision-making.

I think it captured the essence quite well. It also highlights the personal nature of the content. What do you think? Does this description resonate with your experience of the blog?

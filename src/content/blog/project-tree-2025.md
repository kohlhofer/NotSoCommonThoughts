Following up on [AI Unblocked My Learning](/blog/ai-unblocked-learning), here's a tree view of the projects, experiments, and explorations I have done to date. This is what unblocked learning looks like in practice.

You can also see which ideas inspired others. There is even more that I decided not to pursue and there would be much more to mention if I were to indicate how all this connects to the much larger body of my daily work.

By the way, MIDI Volume Control is the first desktop app I have ever created and I am using it every day all day long.

## 2025

Each branch represents a project or experiment, with sub-branches showing related work.

## The Numbers

- **15+ projects in 9 months** across web, desktop, and experimental domains
- **Multiple technologies**: WebAssembly, D3.js, MIDI, AI integration
- **Various purposes**: Personal tools, creative experiments, commercial ventures
- **One year** of unblocked experimentation

This is what happens when the friction of learning disappears. When you can go from idea to working prototype in hours instead of days. When the overhead of experimentation becomes negligible.

The question remains: *"Of all the things you can now do, which do you choose to do?"* But at least now we can afford to ask it through action, not just theory.

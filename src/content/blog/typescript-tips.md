TypeScript adds powerful type safety to JavaScript. Here are some tips to help you write better TypeScript code.

## Type Safety

### Type Inference
- Let TypeScript infer types when possible
- Use explicit types for public APIs
- Leverage type narrowing
- Use type guards effectively

### Advanced Types
- Union and intersection types
- Mapped types
- Conditional types
- Utility types

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Use interfaces for objects
- Prefer type aliases for unions
- Keep types close to usage
- Document complex types

### Error Handling
- Use custom error types
- Leverage type narrowing
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Type your error states

## Development Tips

### Configuration
- Strict mode settings
- Path aliases
- Module resolution
- Type checking options

### Tooling
- ESLint integration
- Prettier setup
- Type checking in CI
- Source maps

## Conclusion

TypeScript is more than just typesâ€”it's a tool for writing more maintainable and reliable code. Use these features to build better software.

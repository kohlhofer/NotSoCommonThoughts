What started as a D3 prototype turned into my daily thinking tool. [MapsAll.com](https://mapsall.com) is where AI meets spatial thinking—a mind mapping platform that helps me (and now others) make sense of everything from meeting notes to strategy docs.

## Why Spatial Interfaces?

The core idea behind MapsAll is simple: LLMs are powerful, but interacting with them through linear text is like exploring a forest with a flashlight—you only see one thing at a time. Spatial interfaces offer a more natural way to interact with AI-generated content, making it easier to spot connections and navigate complex information landscapes.

With MapsAll, you can dive into any topic from a simple prompt and generate a comprehensive mind map. The AI breaks down complex subjects into interconnected nodes, creating a visual structure that reveals relationships and hierarchies at a glance. It’s like having a conversation with an AI that thinks in maps instead of paragraphs.

## The Beginning: Vibe Coding Experiments

It all started with a simple D3-powered mind mapping prototype I created as a proof of concept on AI and spatial interfaces. You can still see this early version at [kohlhofer.com/mindmap](https://kohlhofer.com/mindmap) (I removed the AI functionality but it come with examples). This was my first attempt at creating an interactive mind mapping tool, and it was a great learning experience in D3.js, AI, and the fundamentals of mind mapping interfaces.

I published the prototype as a part of my "Bits & Pieces" collection - a series of creative experiments where I explore the intersection of design, code, and art. You can find it alongside other experiments at [kohlhofer.com/bits](https://kohlhofer.com/bits).

## Evolution to a Full Product

After the initial prototype, I created a more deliberate version of MapsAll with a better architecture and proper user management. This version includes all the essential features a product needs:

- User authentication and management
- Blog for updates and tutorials
- Pricing page
- Shared maps functionality
- And more...

## Daily Usage

What started as an experiment has become an integral part of my daily workflow. I use MapsAll for tracking todos, organizing books I'm reading, planning projects, and structuring blog posts. It's become my go-to tool for organizing thoughts and ideas, whether I'm working on a new project or just trying to make sense of my reading list. One of the most valuable features is the ability to translate long-form meeting notes into spatial maps using AI, which helps capture all key aspects in a structured, visual format that makes complex discussions much easier to navigate and reference later.

You can see some of my [shared maps](https://www.mapsall.com/users/cm9m83cfc0000ie04e9bf8f39), like this deep dive into [the state of AI](https://mapsall.com/shared/cmaszgklx0003l204aap7cbti).

### Community Growth

The most exciting part is seeing others start to use and share their maps. For example, check out this [shared map](https://mapsall.com/shared/cmay671ts0004lb04iszweim8) from another user.

## What's Next?

The journey from “vibe coding” to a full product was fast, hands-on, and deeply educational. I found myself switching hats constantly—designer, developer, marketer, user, tester—each iteration pulling the idea forward a little more. It was rapid, messy, and rewarding.


Whether you're a founder, a student, or just someone with too many thoughts to hold in one place—give [MapsAll.com](https://mapsall.com) a try. I'd love to hear how you're using it and what maps you're making.

I'm excited to continue developing MapsAll.

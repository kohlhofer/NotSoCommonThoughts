I am tired of the whole "AI slop" topic and think that attempts to distinguish authorship will be short-lived. Either something is worth reading or it is not. That has always been true.

The risk isn't AI-generated content—it's AI *summarization* of content. When we rely on AI to digest and condense everything for us, we lose the deep processing, retention, and critical thinking that comes from engaging with long-form writing.

The discussion around AI-generated content often misses the point. We've always had more content than we could possibly consume—thousands of books published daily, endless blog posts and articles, social media feeds that never end. The challenge isn't new, just accelerated.

The question has always been: **What is worth your time and attention?**

## Content Quality Over Authorship

Text can be good or bad, written with or without AI. What matters is whether there are valuable ideas contained within and if they are well and appropriately expressed. The distinction between human and AI authorship is becoming increasingly irrelevant—what counts is the quality of thought and the clarity of expression.

A poorly written human piece offers no more value than a poorly conceived AI piece. Conversely, a well-crafted AI piece can contain insights worth engaging with, just as a well-crafted human piece can. The focus should be on the ideas themselves, not the tool used to express them.

## The Danger of AI Summarization

The risk I see is not AI-generated content, but AI *summarization* of content. When we rely on AI to digest and condense everything for us, we lose deep processing as long-form writing forces us to hold complex ideas in our minds, make connections, and build mental models. We lose retention as skimming summaries doesn't create the same neural pathways as wrestling with ideas over time. We lose critical thinking when we don't engage with the full argument, missing nuance, context, and the opportunity to disagree. And we lose patience as the ability to sit with uncertainty and complexity is becoming a rare skill.

## Curation Trumps Consumption

The real skill of our time isn't distinguishing human from AI content, it's curating what's worth our attention. This means being selective, not everything needs to be read, watched, or consumed. It means going deep when something resonates, give it the time it deserves. It means building context, understanding the broader conversation, not just isolated pieces. And it means trusting your judgment as you know what's worth your time.

## My Approach

I write because I enjoy capturing thoughts—old and new—in a way that feels authentic to me. Whether AI helped with the process or not is less important than whether the ideas are worth engaging with.

You'll be the judge if my writing is worth your time and attention. I know they are very much my thoughts, and I enjoy capturing them in a way that I see fit.

The goal isn't to distinguish human from AI content. It's to distinguish what's worth reading from what's not. That distinction has always mattered, and it always will.

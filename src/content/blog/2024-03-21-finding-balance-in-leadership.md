I had an interesting chat at work the other day about micro-management. It reminded me about this long held belief that much of leadership is really about setting guardrails and finding the right balance.

Set the guardrails too tight, and you crush any chance of real ownership or fresh ideas. Too loose, and people are just flailing around without direction. You're not doing anyone any favors either way.

The tricky part is that the sweet spot looks different for everyone. Some people need more structure, while others thrive with more freedom. It's not about finding one perfect formula—it's about tuning it to each person and situation.

When you get it right though, that's when the magic happens. The team's results greatly exceed your own abilities and aspirations. People actually care about what they're doing because they have the space to make it their own. They're not just following your playbook—they're writing a better one together.

This is what leadership is about to me: creating just enough structure to keep things moving forward, while leaving plenty of room for others to surprise you. Isn't this how we all deserve to be treated? And I would not want to work without those moments of delight and surprise.

*Note: Some of my thoughts on this were likely informed by "The New One Minute Manager" which I read years ago, particularly its Situational Leadership model that emphasizes tailoring leadership style to each person's development.*

A manager and mentor of mine once gave me advice that stuck: just do more of the things you enjoy. 

With seniority comes freedomâ€”but also responsibility, and, more often than not, stress. I'm expected to figure out my own goals and the best way to have impact. That's a lot to carry, and it's easy to get stuck in the daily mire of meetings, process, and busy work.

**Just do more of the things you enjoy** 

That simple cue was exactly what I needed. It helped me de-clutter my days, find more joy in my work, and, as a result, have more impact.

There's something deeply unsettling about being comfortable when you shouldn't be.

During the early days of COVID, I watched as friends and colleagues were suddenly thrust into remote work, isolated in small apartments, struggling to balance work and childcare, while people around the world were dying in unprecedented numbers. The world felt like it was collapsing, and yet there I was—already working remotely for years, living in a spacious home, almost enjoying the kids' remote schooling.

I should have been grateful, and I was. But I was also troubled.

The contrast was jarring. While others were experiencing genuine hardship and loss, my daily routine barely changed. I continued to sit at my desk, attend meetings, review designs, manage projects—all while the world outside was in crisis. It made work feel like a pretend activity, disconnected from the state of the world.

How could I justify spending hours on a design review when people were dying? When systems were failing? When the very fabric of society seemed to be unraveling?

## The Pretend Game

Work became a kind of theater. We'd log into Zoom, discuss quarterly goals, plan sprints, debate technical decisions—all while pretending that everything was normal. The meetings felt increasingly surreal, like we were actors in a play about productivity while the audience was dying.

I found myself asking: What does my design work accomplish in the face of global crisis? What does any of our work accomplish?

The answer, of course, was that it mattered to the people who needed our products, to the companies that employed us, to the economy that was struggling to stay afloat. But that felt like a rationalization, not a genuine answer.

## Fast Forward

If anything, the sense of unreality has only grown worse. The systems that have been stable for decades are dissolving. Wars and conflicts rage. Political discourse has become unrecognizable. The climate crisis accelerates. And then there is the specter of AI—with its great promises and simultaneous threats to change everything we've come to rely on.

Knowledge work, the economy, education, healthcare, governance—all of it is being transformed by forces we barely understand. And yet we continue to play our part.

## The Discomfort of Comfort

The most troubling part is that I don't know how to do differently. I don't know how to respond to this sense of unreality. 

My responsibility to my children makes it prohibitive to just give in to despair or to abandon the stability that our family relies on. I can't simply walk away from my work, no matter how disconnected it feels, because I have people depending on me. The very comfort that troubles me is also what I'm obligated to maintain.

The worst part is that we barely talk about it. In our professional lives, there's a silent, uncomfortable agreement to maintain the facade—to discuss quarterly goals and sprint planning as if everything is normal. Nobody forces us to do this. We all just know, without saying it, that we're not supposed to acknowledge the disconnect, to question whether any of this matters.

## The Uncertainty

This isn't a positive post. I don't have answers. But I do have questions. And sometimes, in the midst of all this pretending, that feels like the most honest thing I can offer.

What makes it all worse is that a great many people seem to either genuinely don't see any of this—or worse, actively cheer it all on.

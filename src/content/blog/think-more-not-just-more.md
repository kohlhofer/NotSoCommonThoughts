For as long as I can remember, I've made it a point to carve out time for thinking—real, undistracted thinking. It's a habit that has shaped my work and my life, even before AI started transforming the way we get things done.

Now, with AI making so many tasks faster and easier, it's tempting to use every saved minute to simply do more. But I've learned that if I fill all that reclaimed time with more tasks, the real value of these productivity gains gets lost in the noise of a busier day.

Instead, I try to protect some of that time for reflection. I let my mind wander, connect ideas, and sometimes get a little constructively distracted. This isn't just a luxury—it's a practice that keeps me adaptable and creative, not just efficient.

The world may be obsessed with productivity, but I've believe that the future belongs to those who make space for critical thinking, not just those who check off the most boxes.

Performance optimization in React is crucial for delivering a smooth user experience. Here are practical techniques you can implement today.

## Memoization

Use React's built-in memoization tools:

- `React.memo` for component memoization
- `useMemo` for expensive computations
- `useCallback` for function memoization

## Code Splitting

Implement code splitting to reduce initial bundle size:

- Dynamic imports with `React.lazy`
- Route-based code splitting
- Component-level code splitting

## Virtualization

For long lists, implement virtualization:

- `react-window` for fixed-size lists
- `react-virtualized` for variable-size lists
- Custom virtualization for specific needs

## Performance Monitoring

Track performance metrics:

- React DevTools Profiler
- Lighthouse audits
- Custom performance metrics

## Conclusion

Remember: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Profile first, optimize second. Focus on the bottlenecks that actually impact user experience.

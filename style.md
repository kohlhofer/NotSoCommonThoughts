### Voice & Tone
- First-person, reflective, and candid; mix personal anecdotes with actionable takeaways.
- Confident but approachable—write as an experienced practitioner sharing lessons.
- Use direct sentences and avoid fluff; most paragraphs sit at 1–3 sentences.
- Tension between personal need and broader principle is a recurring hook.
- End with an open question or invitation to reflect whenever it fits.

### Structure
- Front matter follows: title, description, date, slug (optional), tags array, featured flag, `unlisted` when needed.
- Introductions lead with a decisive statement, observation, or problem before offering context.
- Use `##` headings for major sections; titles are Title Case and specific.
- Section count is flexible but each conveys a single idea (problem, approach, lesson, pattern).
- Include summary-style subsections such as numbered or bulleted lists when explaining frameworks, principles, or data.
- Close with a short reflection, call-to-action, or restated principle—no formal conclusion heading.

### Formatting Patterns
- Mix short paragraphs with lists to keep pacing brisk.
- Use bold for key concepts (`**Term**`) and italics for emphasis or quoted thoughts (`*“…”*`).
- Inline links back to personal projects, prior posts, or external references; descriptive link text is preferred.
- Images reinforce the story; use Markdown `![Alt text](/images/file.png)` or HTML `<img>` when width control matters.
- Leverage tables or ASCII diagrams when summarizing structured information (see project-tree-2025.md).

### Content Moves
- Frame stories around a personal trigger (need, frustration, curiosity) and trace the response.
- Highlight what surprised you, what changed, or the “pattern” discovered—connect personal insight to universal lesson.
- When discussing work, spell out the operational steps or features before extracting broader principles.
- Call out metrics or counts (e.g., “15+ projects in 9 months”) to ground reflections in specifics.
- Reinforce recurring guiding question (“Of all the things you can now do…”) when relevant to choice and focus.

### Language & Rhythm
- Prefer active voice and present tense unless recounting a sequence.
- Introduce rhetorical questions sparingly to prompt reader introspection.
- Maintain conversational clarity—jargon is fine when contextualized.
- Avoid filler transitions; let bold statements open sections.

### Images & Media
- Place hero images near the top if they anchor the story; supplement deeper in the post when supporting details.
- Use captions implicitly via surrounding text—no standalone caption format observed.

### Publishing Checklist
- Confirm YAML front matter dates and slugs follow `YYYY-MM-DD` and kebab case conventions.
- Run through headings, emphasis, and links to ensure consistency with the patterns above.
- Ensure closing line echoes the core principle or leaves the reader with a pointed question.
